# Marshall

**[Marshall](https://github.com/LPLP-ghacc/Marshall/releases)** is a desktop application based on **WPF (.NET 7)**, which allows you to manage and run Python scripts in convenient visual blocks.  
Each block can execute a separate script, restart automatically at a preset interval, and also save its state between program launches.

The Marshall application is designed as a tool for automating and adding Python scripts to a virtual environment.

## ⚙️ How to use

1. **Make sure that [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3925/)** is installed and added to the PATH.  
2. Launch Marshall App.
3. Add a new block in the upper panel.
4. In the "Edit" menu, select your `.py` file.
5. If the `.py` script requires text input, there is a text input button for this.
6. If necessary, enable **startup cycling** and set the interval.  
7. The state is saved automatically — the next time you start, everything will be restored.
